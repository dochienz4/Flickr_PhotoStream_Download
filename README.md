# Flickr_PhotoStream_Download
This is a little assignment I came up with to try to learn how to use selenium at a basic level, hope it doesn't break any laws


In main.py, change the values to yours
```python
# path folder, the folder you manna store all the images, don't let your girl see it :V 
    pathFolder = 'PATH/TO/YOUR/FOLDER/'
# the link to the photo stream on Flickr, one more time, don't let her see it :V
    photoStreamLink = 'PATH/TO/YOUR/LINK/'
# remember to change the value for yourself :V
```
after changed values, run it by your computer :)
